# HardMagic BriefLock

This directory is the source-controlled infrastructure and runtime for HardMagic Corporation's gated technical briefs and qualified consulting intake. It is a HardMagic-specific port of the BriefLock pattern—not a copy of another company's live IDs, secrets, PDFs, or deployment workflow.

No resource in this package has been deployed by adding these files.

## Boundary

The target boundary is:

- resource group: `rg-hardmagic-briefs`;
- public edge host: `briefs.hardmagic.com`;
- runtime: Node 22 Azure Functions Flex Consumption;
- private storage: anonymous Blob access disabled, shared keys disabled, OAuth by default;
- private containers: `briefs`, `ledger`, `deadletter`, and `deployments`;
- dedicated user-assigned runtime identity and dedicated Key Vault;
- a custom ACS runtime role limited to Communication Service read/write (no key listing, key rotation, delete, or domain administration);
- Azure Communication Services Email with the display name `HardMagic Corporation`;
- Dream Dataverse projection into `hm_briefengagement`, keyed by `hm_requestid`;
- Application Insights, Log Analytics, retention policies, and a production failure alert.

The web page never serves a PDF. It posts qualification data to the edge host; the Function writes the durable delivery ledger, creates a 48-hour read-only user-delegation SAS for one exact PDF, emails it, and queues CRM projection. A Dynamics outage cannot force a visitor to resubmit or receive a duplicate delivery.

## HardMagic intake taxonomy

The runtime accepts only these service lanes:

- creative direction;
- GenAI;
- media management;
- marketing consulting;
- product strategy;
- creative technology.

Brief requests require role, industry, size, decision stage, decision horizon, challenge, preferred next step, resource-specific consent, and a selected lane. Consultation requests require a mandate and decision horizon. Broader marketing consent is separate and defaults to `no`.

## Source-of-truth and release model

GitLab in the `hardmagic` organization is authoritative. Include `.gitlab/ci/brief-delivery.yml` from the repository's root pipeline. The production apply job is:

- limited to `demo`;
- manual and non-optional once started;
- attached to the protected `brief-lock/production` environment;
- serialized with a GitLab resource group;
- authenticated with a GitLab OIDC ID token;
- gated by `BRIEF_CONFIRM=PROVISION-HARDMAGIC-BRIEFLOCK`.

Required protected and masked CI/CD variables:

```text
AZURE_CLIENT_ID
AZURE_TENANT_ID
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
BRIEF_FRONT_DOOR_ID
BRIEF_DEPLOYMENT_PRINCIPAL_OBJECT_ID
BRIEF_ALERT_ACTION_GROUP_RESOURCE_ID
```

The OIDC service principal and its federated credential are bootstrapped outside this deployment. Give it only the control-plane scope required for `rg-hardmagic-briefs`; the template separately limits its data-plane Blob role to the `deployments` container. Never store a client secret in GitLab.

## Validation

```bash
cd infra/brief-delivery/function
npm ci
npm run check
npm test
npm run build
```

Compile Bicep without contacting Azure:

```bash
az bicep build --file infra/brief-delivery/main.bicep --stdout > /dev/null
```

Use the GitLab manual `what-if` job before the protected apply. `parameters.example.json` contains names and placeholders only. Sender address, challenge secret, unsubscribe HMAC key, and Dataverse IDs must be written to the dedicated Key Vault by an authorized secret-management process; they never cross the deployment command line.

## Required external work

This package intentionally does not pretend to own the shared edge or Dataverse control planes. Before deployment is usable:

1. The shared Front Door Terraform authority must create `briefs.hardmagic.com`, route only `/api/brief-request`, `/api/contact-request`, `/api/unsubscribe`, and `/api/health`, preserve the host, and attach the WAF controls in [EDGE-INTEGRATION.md](EDGE-INTEGRATION.md).
2. The HardMagic Dataverse solution, application user, role, BU, Account, team, and custom table must match [DATAVERSE-CONTRACT.md](DATAVERSE-CONTRACT.md).
3. A custom ACS sender domain must be verified and its sender address added to Key Vault.
4. Turnstile must be configured on both forms before production; the production default fails closed when it is absent.
5. Reviewed PDFs must be uploaded to `briefs` using Entra ID and the exact catalog filenames. Do not add PDFs to this infrastructure directory or a public site directory.

See [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md) for acceptance, recovery, deletion, and privacy controls.
